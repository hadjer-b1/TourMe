        "body": "Jungle survival is all about respecting an environment that is both beautiful and brutal. Start by learning how to find clean water ‚Äî rivers and rain collection are safest. Fire is essential for warmth, cooking, and keeping predators away. Edible plants can be identified by testing small amounts slowly, but it's safer to stick to known fruits and nuts. Avoid brightly colored or strong-smelling plants, as they are often toxic. Navigation can be tricky in dense forests, so use natural markers like rivers, moss growth, or the sun. Finally, always build a simple shelter to stay dry and safe from insects. Remember: energy conservation is as important as food intake in jungle survival."
